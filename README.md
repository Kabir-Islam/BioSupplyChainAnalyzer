# BioSupplyChainAnalyzer

## üìú Overview
The **BioSupplyChainAnalyzer** is a Python-based project designed to analyze supply chain data for biotechnology products. It streamlines data preprocessing, calculates production and transportation costs, and provides insights through analysis and visualization. The program is interactive and menu-driven, making it user-friendly for basic supply chain analysis tasks.

---

## üöÄ Features
### Data Import and Preprocessing
- Reads supply chain data from a CSV file.
- Handles missing or inconsistent data entries.
- Cleans and prepares the dataset for analysis.

### Cost and Time Calculations
- Calculates total production and transportation costs for each product type.
- Computes the total transportation time based on cost and quantity.

### Data Analysis
- Identifies the product with the highest production time.
- Determines the product with the highest transportation cost.
- Calculates the average transportation cost across all products.

### Visualization
- **Bar Chart**: Compares production time and transportation cost for each product type.
- **Pie Chart**: Shows the proportion of total costs for each product type.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the entire project.
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization (bar and pie charts).

## üìÇ Project Structure
bash
CopyEdit
|-- SCM_1.csv                 # Input data file (supply chain data)
|-- main.py                   # Python script containing the full project code
|-- README.md                 # Documentation for the project


## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
Install the required libraries:
bash
CopyEdit
pip install pandas matplotlib


### Steps to Run the Application
Clone the repository or download the project files:
bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supply-chain-management.git
cd supply-chain-management

### Ensure the CSV file (SCM_1.csv) is present in the project directory.
Run the Python script:
bash
CopyEdit
python main.py

### Follow the menu-driven interface to perform tasks like:
Data import and preprocessing.
Cost and time calculations.
Analysis and visualizations.

## üìù How to Use
#### Task 1: Data Import and Preprocessing
Automatically loads and cleans the dataset from SCM_1.csv.
#### Task 2: Cost and Time Calculations
Calculate total production and transportation costs.
Compute total transportation time based on cost and quantity.
#### Task 3: Data Analysis
Identify products with the highest production time or transportation cost.
Calculate the average transportation cost across all products.
#### Task 4: Visualization
Generate a bar chart comparing production time and transportation costs.
Create a pie chart showing the proportion of total costs for each product type.
